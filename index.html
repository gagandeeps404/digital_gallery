<h1>Marchese Retrospective </h1>
<h2>This is the landing page</h2> <p>for Luna Group's full stack web development project. The content will be about the Pace Digital Art Gallery, which ran exhibitions for eleven years, from 2003 to 2013, of breakthrough digital art.  We are showcasing the artists in order of their exhibits by years. Some artists came more than one time to exhibit, however, their art was different in the different years.Members of Luna Group are designing the pages, each one the technical curator for that year's retrospective.  Members of Luna Group and the years they are highlighting in their virtual rooms of the Retrospective:</p>
